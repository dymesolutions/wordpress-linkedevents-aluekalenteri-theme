# Example how to customize Wordpress LinkedEvents plugin output

By default [wordpress-linkedevents](https://github.com/Metatavu/wordpress-linkedevents) plugin renders very basic event list but you can customize the how the list is rendered by adding linkedevents/events.php into you theme.

This repository contains customized theme that lists events and allows user to navigate to next and previous page.

See [linkedevents/events.php](linkedevents/events.php) and [linkedevents/event.php](linkedevents/event.php) for code examples
